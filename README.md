# jquery-app
As my goal of learning the jQuery library , this todo app was developed with the core jQuery methods , interactivity was added a bit 
and the user was given the liberty to create todos , delete them , take a decision about its state whether pending or completed. It also
tried to replicate what a set is called in real world " a group of different entities grouped together ".
